# Hey, I'm Riyon

I like making things. Sometimes it’s small stuff that doesn’t matter to anyone else, but it helps me learn something new. I enjoy building systems, working with logic, and figuring out how to keep the human part in all of it.

I'm currently studying **Computer Science**, while also working on side projects here and there. Some of them are on my [projects](/projects). Over the past few years, I've joined a few [organizations](https://gdg.community.dev/) and event teams that were actually fun to be part of. I also teach programming at a school, or just spend an entire day playing [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) when I need to recharge.

When I'm not at my desk, I'm usually [writing](/blog), playing guitar, [digging for new music](#), going to [gigs](#), or exploring random places while hunting ice cream. Sometimes I just end up journaling random thoughts, breaking down ideas I don’t fully understand yet, or chasing some weird curiosity that turns into a project later.

You can reach me at [@riyonaryono](https://linkedin.com/in/riyonaryono) or [hello@riyonaryono.me](mailto:hello@riyonaryono.me).
